* Description
The purpose of this project is to analyze the type of industrial demand in Bulgaria as a proxy for "true" economic development. 
Arguably, true economic development can be "masked" behind various heavily subsidized development programs.
Such is the case with the numerous European Union development funds in Bulgaria.
These funds are by nature an *external* stimuli to the economy, i.e. to promote sustainable economic growth they must be used to create internal growth opportunities. 

It is a public secret that this is not the case in Bulgaria. European funds are channeled into the hands of oligarchs in a perverted scheme of allocating most development projects to businesses controlled by them. Due to the highly non-competitive nature in which these firms acquire business and operate, they do not offer any innovation (either in technology or business practices) that is paramount to economic development. 

One difficulty in measuring the mismatch between the amount of European funds allocated to Bulgaria and economic development (the *oligarch deadweight*) is a reliably proxy for the latter.
Since many measures exist (e.g. GDP), each with its own shortcomings, I am by no means trying to find the ultimate one. Rather, I am simply trying to look at the problem from a different (data-driven) perspective.

As a proxy for economic development I am using the type of industrial demand in Bulgaria over time.
The idea is that the categories of jobs offered on the market can give a lot of insights about the factors driving  macroeconomic indicators, such as the GDP. Imagine a city where the most offered job is a cashier in a shop.
What could be said about the future economic development in this city? What if, after a decade of infusing external funds into this city, the most offered job is still a cashier in a shop? Were the funds used prudently to create self-sustained growth or were they channeled into private hands? These are the types of questions that motivated this project.

To measure industrial demand, I use data from *jobs.bg*, a popular website for job postings in Bulgaria.
The website exposes the last month of job postings, so I will be crawling it regularly (e.g. for about a year) to collect enough data.
