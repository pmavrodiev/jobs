So far manual hack in computeScaling
  
The inner-most 4 arcs corresponding to the 4 main economic categorizations

ensure that their visual location remains constant when changing municipalities.

Glitch with rescaling the d3 plot in Firefox.  
<svg> container has width(height).animVal.value  equal to 1, which produces
a very small scaling factor and the plot disappears.
